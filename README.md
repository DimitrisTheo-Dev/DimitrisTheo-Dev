Hi there!👋🏻
I am a 19-year-old passionate software engineer from Greece who is highly driven and comfortable with RESTful architecture. I built highly scalable web apps that scaled to thousands of users and drove the product vision for my company. I have been programming since I was 12 years of age, constantly looking for the next brain-stimulating project. I am always excited to work with new frameworks and tools. I love doing web and mobile projects and I have multiple contributions on GitHub.
